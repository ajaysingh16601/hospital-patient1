# React + Vite

## State Management and Persistence

This project integrates Redux for managing application state, Redux Toolkit for simplifying state management logic, and Redux Persist to ensure that the state remains consistent across page refreshes. Redux Toolkit streamlines the development process with features like slices, which group actions and reducers together. Redux Persist stores the state in local storage, enabling persistence of patient data and other key application details.
